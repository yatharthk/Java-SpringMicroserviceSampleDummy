Adding Configuration and Security
1. Consider our ms wants to use configuration : say a db url . we can create a configmap in kubernetes
and can use that in our app
    1. create a config map
        - kubectl create configmap hello-world-config --from-literal=RDS_DB_NAME(key)=todos(value)
    2.
       2.1 see all the config maps using
        - kubectl get configmap
       2.2 see the values in a specific configmap
        - kubectl get configmap hello-world-config

2. Add passwords to our ms:
        Kubernetes Secrets are used to store sensitive data,
        such as passwords, API keys, or certificates, and provide a secure way to access them
        within a pod or deployment.

1. creating a secret in kubernetes : also known as secretsMap
        basic syntax: kubectl create secret <secret-type> <secret-name>

        -  kubectl create secret generic hello-world-web-app-secret1 --from-literal=RDS_PASSWORD=dummyPassword

2. see what details were entered:

        - kubectl describe secret hello-world-app-secret1

        we will not get the password we will just be able to see key used and value size what is entered ,
        since it is a secret we will not be able to get that value fom here.
